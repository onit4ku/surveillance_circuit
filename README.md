# SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing circuit in Andalusia

[Webpage](http://www.clinbioinfosspa.es/COVID_circuit/)

As response to a recommendation for the integration of genome sequencing in the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance published by the Public Health Commission of the Interterritorial council in [22 January 2021](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Integracion_de_la_secuenciacion_genomica-en_la_vigilancia_del_SARS-CoV-2.pdf), a joint instruction was carried out, 1/2020 from the General Secretariat for Research, Development and Innovation in Health and the Management Directorate of the Andalusian Health Service, for the Management of samples in the approach to Personalized Medicine in COVID-19.

A previous project funded by the Andalusian Health System [Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome for the monitoring and management of the Covid-19 epidemic in Andalusia and the rapid generation of prognostic and response to treatment biomarkers](http://clinbioinfosspa.es/projects/covseq/indexEng.html) that included the 16 main tertiary hospitals in Andalusia, along with three research centers with genome sequencing facilities (IBIS, Genyo and CABIMER) and the Bioinformatics Area of the Progress and Health Foundation, set the ground for a rapid implementation of a regional-scale systematic sequencing of the virus. This project constitutes a remarkable example of translational research.
